# LAND REGISTRY

Land Registry is a simple Dapp based on the ethereum blockchain. It can be used as an alternative to the existing approach. Here the land owner registers the land details along with the land value by providing necessary proofs. Only a registrar or government authority who is registered as the superadmin can do the registration process. Lands coming under a particular area (eg., a village) can register to the system only through the superadmin assigned to that area. The smartcontract has been written in such a way that the owner has to transfer
his full asset to the buyer and no partial transaction of the asset is allowed. Even though the registration process requires a government authority, the entire process is transparent and the transaction happens between the the two clients without any intermediaries.
